# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

To imporve the project I continued following BEM structure to better organize my code, allowing me to confidently apply and utilize flexbox, list properties, forms, keyframes, and other advanced HTML and CSS attributes.
